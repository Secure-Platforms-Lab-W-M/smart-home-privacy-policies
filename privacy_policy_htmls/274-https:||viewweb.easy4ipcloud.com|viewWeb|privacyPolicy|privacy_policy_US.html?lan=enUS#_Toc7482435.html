<p>You can  review and change your personal data by logging into your account on our  website and visiting your account profile page. &nbsp;You may also send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@imoulife.com">privacy@imoulife.com </a> to request access to, or require us to correct  or delete any personal data that you have provided to us. You may also object  to or request us to restrict your processing. If we process your personal data  based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us  (see below). A summary of your legal rights is set out below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request access </strong>to  your personal data (commonly known as a “<u>data subject access request</u>”).  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and  to check that we are lawfully processing it.  If you want to access your head portrait, user name, email address and other  basic information, or video, image, order, device and other service information  on your Imou account, you can enter Imou and tap on corresponding function  button to access relevant information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request correction </strong>of  the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any  incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need  to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.  If you want to change your nickname, email address, etc. on your Imou account,  enter Imou, tap on related function button.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request erasure </strong>of  your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal  data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also  have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have  successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we  may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to  erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may  not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal  reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your  request. If you want to delete the basic information  such as email address, and password, or service information such as video,  image, cloud record and alarm on your Imou account, you can delete your  information by tapping on related data clear function button through “Me-&gt;Settings-&gt;Account  and Security-&gt;Delete Account”. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Object to processing </strong><strong>of your personal  data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party)  and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to  object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental  rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing  your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may  demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your  information which override your rights and freedoms.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of  your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of  your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish  the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not  want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no  longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;  or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether  we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Request the transfer </strong>of  your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a  third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,  machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated  information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used  the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where  we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not  affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your  consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain  products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time  you withdraw your consent. If you want to disable user  experience program and alarm information on your Imou account, you can enter  Imou and tap on corresponding close button to turn it off </li>
