Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service. In all of the above cases, your continued use of the Service after any notice or posted modified Privacy Policy indicates acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.

ARTICLE 2. Collection of Personally Identifying Information

In the course of using the Services, you may provide and we may collect certain personally identifying information that can be used to contact or identify you, administer your account and to provide the Services (“Personally Identifying Information” or “PII”). PII may include, but is not limited to, your name, photo, phone number, device information, email address. You may at any time refuse to provide the PII that we request; however, this may limit our ability to sell you products or to provide the Services to you.

ARTICLE 4. Information Related to the Use of the Services

Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both account holders and non-account holders. Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, location, device and browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, frequency with which the Services are used by a user, search terms, the features and links on our Services that a user clicked on or used, and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our users’ needs and preferences.

ARTICLE 5. Device and Application Operation

We may record information relating to the setup, general performance, and operation of our Service, your application and lock (and of other of our locks in your home or business or that you otherwise may access), including device status, logs of those who lock/unlock the device and Service, the members that you invite, and those people who may invite you as a member, to use the device and application. We use this information to allow you (and us) to operate and monitor your device and our Service.

If you enable the Smart-open or Magic-touch feature, the application will track your location using GPS, Wi-Fi, Cellular in order to determine when your application nears KeyWe devices that you have permission to access (e.g. when you are near home). This information will only be stored on your device, and not on our servers. This information will tell your mobile device to start listening for your lock more often (increasing the polling). This improves the KeyWe device’s performance and saves your mobile device’s battery life.

ARTICLE 6. Service Account Set Up

In order to use an KeyWe product, you must download our mobile application and set up an account. During this process, we will ask you for certain information necessary to establish and use your account, including your name, telephone number, email address, and profile photo.

When you use certain features of the Service, in particular our mobile applications, we may receive, store and process different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Service or specific features of the platform). If you access the Service through a mobile device and you do not want your mobile device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your mobile device. See your mobile device manufacturer’s instructions for further details. Of course, if you do this, Service functionality (such as the Smart-open or Magic-touch feature described immediately above) may not work.

ARTICLE 8. Testimonials

We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us.

ARTICLE 9. Changing or Deleting Your Information

All KeyWe users may review, update, correct or delete the PII in their registration profile by logging into their account and changing the “My Pages” associated with their account. Removing your information may limit our ability to provide the Services to you. If you completely delete all such information, your account will be deactivated and you may lose access to the Service and your use of the device. You may also contact us at support@thekeywe.com if you have additional questions or concerns. We’ll take steps to modify or delete your information as soon as is practical, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.

ARTICLE 10. Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally-accepted industry standards to protect the PII submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
