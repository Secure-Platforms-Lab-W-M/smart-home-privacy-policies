                <dd class="wow fadeInUp" style="visibility: hidden; animation-name: none;">All data saved in the back-end is classified into different levels based on the importance and sensitivity of the data, e.g. whether the data contains personal data.</dd>
                <dd class="wow fadeInUp" style="visibility: hidden; animation-name: none;">In the data centers, clusters that contain sensitive data are grouped together in the network topology, and will be placed in rooms with additional physical security protection.</dd>

Currently, Larkkey has data centres in Beijing and Singapore. As a result, we may transfer
