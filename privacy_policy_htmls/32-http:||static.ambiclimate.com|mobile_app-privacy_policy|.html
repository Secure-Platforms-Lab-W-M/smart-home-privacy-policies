      <ul>
         <li>Email address. <br><br>Your account is created using your email address in order to provide you with a unique and easy to remember login identifier. This email address is also used to allow you to reset your password in the event that you have forgotten your password.<br><br>Your email address information is protected in our system, transferred and stored in an encrypted format, and is only accessible by employees if it is needed to enhance our Services (such as to provide you with important notices relating to our Services, or to provide customer and/or technical support in your use of our Services).<br><br>Aside from the use of your email address for login and communication purposes, all other data is depersonalized through the use of a randomly generated user identifier.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>Password.<br><br>The password you submit in your application is transmitted and stored in an encrypted manner. It is never accessible by any of our employees.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Device Setup</strong></h3>
      <p>During your setup of the device, you will also provide us with the following information / data access:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>WiFi network details.<br><br>In the course of connecting the Ambi Climate device to your WiFi network, you provide us with your WiFi SSID name and password. This data is transferred directly by the smartphone application to the Ambi Climate device, and is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li>Device location information<br><br>During the setup of the Ambi Climate device, you provide us with the location of your device (as defined by GPS coordinates). This data is protected in our system, and is transmitted and stored on our servers in an encrypted format.<br><br>This data is used to estimate the outdoor weather conditions at your device locations (required for us to train our artificial intelligence engine to learn the impact of outdoor weather conditions on your comfort, and on the performance of your air conditioner / heat pump). We also use this data to provide a location based control feature which allows the automated control of your air conditioner / heat pump based on the location of your smartphone.<br><br></li>
         <li>Device settings<br><br>During the setup process, you provide us with details such as the name you wish to refer to the location by (e.g. Home), the room name (e.g. Bedroom), and the details of the remote control of your air conditioner / heat pump. We also automatically determine the time zone of the device.<br><br></li>
         <li>Photos<br><br>If you desire to set a personalized background photo in the Ambi Climate smartphone application, you provide us with access to the photos stored on your smartphone. This data is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Environmental data collection</strong></h3>
      <p>During the normal operation of Ambi Climate, we collect environmental data from our onboard sensors, including the:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Temperature, </li>
         <li>Humidity, </li>
         <li>Ambient visible light levels, and</li>
         <li>the infrared light conditions in the room. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is used to provide you with the ability to monitor current room conditions via the Ambi Climate smartphone application, and to train our artificial intelligence engine to learn the impact of these factors on your comfort, and on the performance of your air conditioner / heat pump.</p>
      <h3><strong>Usage</strong></h3>
      <p>We also collect data on your usage of our system, including:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Control Events. <br><br>Whenever you make changes to the state of your air conditioner / heat pump (e.g. when you turn on or off the air conditioner / heat pump, change the set point temperature, or other settings), this information is recorded and transmitted to our Ambi Climate servers. This allows us to provide you with a list of your historical adjustments, and allows our artificial intelligence engine to learn about the performance of your air conditioner / heat pump. <br><br>Similarly, whenever you use your original remote control, the infrared signal from your remote control is captured and coded to provide us with similar information.<br><br>Information about your usage of our Services is also captured in a similar way, for example, whenever you activate or deactivate one of the Ambi Climate modes, the adjustments made by the Ambi Climate system, and so on.<br><br></li>

         <li>Device Settings<br><br>Any changes you make to the settings on your Ambi Climate device (such as setting timers, or changing the brightness of the LED, etc) are also recorded on our servers.<br><br></li>
         <li>Smartphone Location Information<br><br>To allow the use of geolocation services (such as the ability to automatically turn on/off your air conditioner / heat pump based on your proximity to the device), we collect information about the location of your smartphone. The precise location of your smartphone is only collected on your smartphone to determine if you have entered one of the zones you define in the setup of the location based control feature, and is never transmitted to our servers. Only data relating to the entry / exit of such a zone is recorded in our servers.<br><br>The third-party customer communication system that we use (Intercom) also estimates your location (to your nearest city). For details as to how Intercom safeguards this personal information, please refer to the <a href="https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy">Intercom Privacy Policy</a>.<br><br></li>
         <li>Integrations<br><br>One of the features that we offer is the ability to integrate your Ambi Climate system with certain third-party integrations, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT and more. To activate this integration, you will be required to grant consent to the third-party integration to access our system, resulting in an authorization token being generated on our system. Please refer to the corresponding privacy policies of these third-party services.</li>
