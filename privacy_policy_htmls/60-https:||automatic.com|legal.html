Apple-Enabled Software Applications.</h5><p>Automatic offers Software applications that are intended to be operated in connection with products made commercially available by Apple Inc. (“Apple”), among other platforms. With respect to Software that is made available for your use in connection with an Apple-branded product (such Software, “Apple-Enabled Software”), in addition to the other terms and conditions set forth in these TOS, the following terms and conditions apply:</p><p>4.1 Automatic and you acknowledge that this TOS is concluded between Automatic and you only, and not with Apple, and that as between Automatic and Apple, Automatic, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Apple-Enabled Software and the content thereof.</p><p>4.2 You may not use the Apple-Enabled Software in any manner that is in violation of or inconsistent with the Usage Rules set forth for Apple-Enabled Software in, or otherwise be in conflict with, the App Store Terms of Service.</p><p>4.3 Your license to use the Apple-Enabled Software is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Apple-Enabled Software on an iOS Product that you own or control, as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Service.</p><p>4.4 Apple has no obligation whatsoever to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software.</p><p>4.5 Apple is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law. In the event of any failure of the Apple-Enabled Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Apple-Enabled Software to you, if any; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, which will be Automatic’s sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable law.</p><p>4.6 Automatic and you acknowledge that Automatic, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the Apple-Enabled Software or your possession and/or use of that Apple-Enabled Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Apple-Enabled Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p><p>4.7 In the event of any third party claim that the Apple-Enabled Software or the end-user’s possession and use of that Apple-Enabled Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Automatic and Apple, Automatic, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.</p><p>4.8 You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p><p>4.9 If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, they should be directed to Automatic as follows:</p><p><a href="mailto:support@automatic.com">support@automatic.com</a><br>Automatic Labs, Inc.<br>128 King Street, 3rd Floor<br>San Francisco, CA 94107</p><p>4.10 Automatic and you acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this TOS with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this TOS, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this TOS against you with respect to the Apple-Enabled Software as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p><h5>5. Payment</h5><p>5.1 To the extent the Service, Hardware or any portion thereof is made available for any fee, you will be required to select a payment plan or make a payment and provide Automatic information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to Automatic that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Automatic the amount that is specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and this TOS. If your payment plan involves subscription payments, you hereby authorize Automatic to bill your payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges you must let Automatic know within sixty (60) days after the date that Automatic charges you. We reserve the right to change Automatic’s prices. If Automatic does change prices, Automatic will provide you with notice of the change on the Site or in email to you, at Automatic’s option, at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. Note that you (and not Automatic) are responsible for any charges or fees payable to third parties in connection with the Service, such as emergency responders.</p><p>5.2 Automatic reserves the right to charge you a device deposit in conjunction with any specialty services.</p><p>5.3 If you are a Fleet Service user, you must return any devices held in your possession in order to effectively terminate the service and not be charged for additional use of the Fleet Service. You may be charged a replacement fee for any lost, stolen, broken, damaged or otherwise non-functioning devices. Replacement Fees are $50 USD for Second Generation (“Link 2”) devices and $100 USD for Third Generation (“Link 3”) devices (“Replacement Fee”). If a device is lost, stolen, broken, damaged or otherwise non-functioning during your use of the Fleet Service, you may request replacement device(s) for the associated Replacement Fee. Any replacement devices must also be returned to effectively terminate the Fleet Service.</p><h5>6. Representations and Warranties</h5><p>You represent and warrant to Automatic that: (i) you have full power and authority to enter into this TOS; (ii) you own all Your Content or have obtained all permissions, releases, rights or licenses required to engage in your data collection using the Hardware, posting and other activities (and allow Automatic to perform its obligations) in connection with the Service and Hardware without obtaining any further releases or consents; (iii) Your Content and other activities in connection with the Service and Automatic’s exercise of all rights and license granted by you herein, do not and will not violate, infringe, or misappropriate any third party’s copyright, trademark, right of privacy or publicity, or other personal or proprietary right, nor does Your Content contain any matter that is defamatory, obscene, unlawful, threatening, abusive, tortious, offensive or harassing; and (iv) you are fifteen (15) years of age or older.</p><h5>7.

Automatic shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuation of the Service or Hardware. Automatic will use good faith efforts to contact you to warn you prior to suspension or termination of your account by Automatic. All of Your Content on the Service (if any) may be permanently deleted by Automatic upon any termination of your account in its sole discretion. If Automatic terminates your account without cause and you have signed up for a fee-bearing service, Automatic will refund the pro-rated, unearned portion of any amount that you have prepaid to Automatic for such Service. However, all accrued rights to payment and the terms of Section 5-14 shall survive termination of this TOS.</p><h5>8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h5><p>THE HARDWARE COMES WITH A <a href="#warranty">LIMITED WARRANTY</a> FOR MORE DETAILS. THE SERVICE, INCLUDING THE SITE, CONTENT AND ANY DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR SERVICE, AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND AUTOMATIC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS OR RELIABILITY.

NO INFORMATION, ADVICE OR SERVICES OBTAINED BY YOU FROM AUTOMATIC OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS TOS. IN PARTICULAR, ALTHOUGH AUTOMATIC ENDEAVORS TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL DETECTION OF MOST CRASHES, NOT ALL CRASHES MAY BE DETECTED AND AUTOMATIC DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE OR HARDWARE WILL DETECT AND/OR REPORT ALL VEHICLE CRASHES OR THAT EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE EVENT OF ANY CRASH. AUTOMATIC IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF THE USER, OR OF ANY EMERGENCY RESPONDERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS WE MAY CONTACT ON YOUR BEHALF, OR FOR THE SERVICE’S INABILITY TO CONTACT ANY EMERGENCY RESPONDER OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER IN ANY PARTICULAR SITUATION. FURTHER, THE SERVICE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT USE OF THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL RESULT IN ANY GAS SAVINGS OR EFFICIENCIES OR THAT VEHICLE ERROR DETECTION WILL BE ACCURATE OR ERROR-FREE.

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS TOS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS TOS.</p><p>9.2 SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHICH MEANS THAT SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Automatic’s defense of such matter.</p><h5>11. Assignment</h5><p>You may not assign this TOS without the prior written consent of Automatic, but Automatic may assign or transfer this TOS, in whole or in part, without restriction.</p><h5>12. Governing Law</h5><p>This TOS shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to the principles of conflicts of law. Unless otherwise elected by Automatic in a particular instance, you hereby expressly agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the State of California for the purpose of resolving any dispute relating to your access to or use of the Service or Hardware.</p><h5>13. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration</h5><p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at <a href="mailto:support@automatic.com">support@automatic.com</a>. In the unlikely event that our customer care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Automatic has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than $75,000 in damages, Automatic will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail. Automatic will not seek attorneys’ fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p><p>13.1 Arbitration Agreement: Automatic and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li><li>claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li><li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li><li>claims that may arise after the termination of this TOS.</li></ul><p>References to “Automatic”, “you”, and “us” include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this TOS, you and Automatic are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This TOS evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this TOS.</p><p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Automatic should be sent to the address located in Section 15 of this Terms of Service (“Notice Address”). The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Automatic and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Automatic may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Automatic or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Automatic is entitled.</p><p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this TOS, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this TOS. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. Unless Automatic and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Automatic will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p><p>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p><p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. YOU AND AUTOMATIC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Automatic agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p><p>13.2 Notwithstanding any provision in this TOS to the contrary, we agree that if Automatic makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service or Hardware, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p><h5>14. Privacy</h5><p>Please read the <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how Automatic collects and uses personal information. By using the Service or the Hardware, you consent to our collection and use of personal data as outlined therein.</p><h5>15. Notice for California Users</h5><p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, users of the Hardware from California are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210. You may contact us at Automatic Labs, Inc., 128 King Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94107 (“Notice Address”).</p><h5>16. Questions? Concerns?
