		<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
		<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our goal is to provide you with a positive experience on our websites and when using our apps (Link2Home), products and services, while at the same time keeping your Personal Information, as defined below, secure. Our privacy practices are described below, as well as in separate notices given when an app, product or service is purchased or downloaded (our "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy covers all Link2Home Products and Link2Home websites. By visiting our websites, using Link2Home Products or providing us with your Personal Information (as defined below), you are accepting and consenting to the practices, terms and conditions described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p>For ease of reference, we will use the following terms in this Privacy Policy: "Link2Home", "our", "us" or "we" means Link2Home Technology Co., Limited., Includes all Link2Home branded apps, products and services.</p>
		<h4>Types of Information Covered by This Privacy Policy</h4>
		<p>Link2Home may collect both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. "Personal Information" means any information that can be used to identify you. Some examples of Personal Information include your email address. "Non-Personal Information" means information that on its own cannot be used to identify you. Some examples of Non-Personal Information include usage data relating to Link2Home websites and Products, language preferences and our website page views.</p>
		<p>Information may be aggregated and/or anonymized. When information is aggregated, it is combined with information about other customers and users. When information is anonymized, Personal Information is removed from collected data and the remaining portion of the data, containing only Non-Personal Information, is repurposed for internal or external use. Aggregated information that includes Personal Information is considered Personal Information until it has been anonymized. Anonymized information is considered Non-Personal Information. In general, usage data collected when you visit Link2Home websites or use Link2Home Products is both aggregated and anonymized so it does not identify you personally and is therefore Non-Personal Information.</p>

If we are informed that we have collected the Personal Information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete that Personal Information from our systems. If you believe we might have inadvertently collected Personal Information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at service@Link2Home.com.</p>

We will inform you (before collecting your Personal Information) if we intend to use your Personal Information for marketing purposes, or if we intend to disclose your Personal Information to any third party for marketing purposes.</p>
		<p>We will always give you choices about your Personal Information.

One form of Opt-out is clicking the Unsubscribe link in a marketing email. This will take you off of our marketing email list. Link2Home's general policy is to have users Opt-in, rather than Opt-out, to receive marketing information and to allow the sharing of information with third parties. Please note that these Opt-in/Opt-out choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory website, service or software communications, such as update or downtime information, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel your service or order or terminate use of software in accordance with the applicable terms of use or license agreement.</p>
		<!-- New Link2Home Products -->

		<!-- Retention of Personal Information -->
		<h4>Retention of Personal Information</h4>
		<p>We will only retain your Personal Information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required for legitimate business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise as permitted by law.</p>
		<!--Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Web Tools   -->
		<h4>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Web Tools</h4>
		<p>We use automatic data collection tools like cookies, embedded web links and widgets (collectively, "web tools"). These web tools collect certain information that your browser or your mobile device sends to Link2Home websites and Link2Home Products, such as computer IP address, browser type and service provider. In addition, Link2Home uses small pieces of code called web beacons. Web beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. This allows Link2Home to collect information such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referring page you previously visited, what browser or mobile device you are using, and your display settings. Link2Home and its advertising partners use web beacons, for example, to find out if advertising on Link2Home websites and other websites that contain Link2Home ads is effective, or if certain videos on Link2Home websites are being viewed.</p>
		<p>Link2Home may use web tools for the following purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To identify the user's country and language and distinguish you from other users of Link2Home websites.</li>
			<li>To save your registration information for future use on Link2Home websites and services.</li>
			<li>To allow customer surveys to appear or not appear to customers.</li>
			<li>To optimize your browsing experience by preloading certain features of Link2Home websites and services on future visits to make loading times faster and more efficient.</li>
			<li>To understand how you use and interact with Link2Home websites and services.</li>
			<li>To improve Link2Home websites and services.</li>
			<li>To count visitors to Link2Home websites and Link2Home Products and analyze website traffic, such as how many visitors have come to the Link2Home websites from advertisements on advertising partner websites.</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- Security -->
		<h4>Security</h4>
		<p>We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information collected by Link2Home websites and Products. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security; any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
		<p>It is important to note that if you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted Personal Information. If you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.</p>
		<p>We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. You should also be aware that names that you give your Wi-Fi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as "friendly names") may be detectable by others outside your home, so you should not use Personal Information as part of your friendly names.</p>
		<!--Updates and Upgrades  -->
		<h4>Updates and Upgrades</h4>
		<p>Link2Home Products may be updated or upgraded from time to time to provide additional features, address technical issues, and generally make your user experience better. Some Link2Home Products include an auto-update feature, which gives us the ability to make updates automatically. You can change auto-update options by changing your settings within the Link2Home Product account information. In very limited cases, updates may still be automatically applied, regardless of the auto-update setting. For example, we may provide an automatic update that fixes a security breach to your network.</p>
		<!-- Updates to this Privacy Policy -->
		<h4>Updates to this Privacy Policy</h4>
		<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it frequently. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or prominently post a notice on this website.</p>
