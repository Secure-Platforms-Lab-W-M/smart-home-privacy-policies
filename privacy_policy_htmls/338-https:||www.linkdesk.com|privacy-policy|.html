<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">6. Use Of Your Data For Direct Advertising</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #ffffff;">6.1 If you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter, we will send you regular information about our offers. The only mandatory information for sending the newsletter is your e-mail address and your first name. The indication of additional possible data is voluntary and is used to be able to address you personally. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure for sending the newsletter. This means that we will not send you an e-mail newsletter, unless you have expressly confirmed to us that you agree to the sending of the newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive future newsletters by clicking on an appropriate link.<br>By activating the confirmation link, you give us your consent to the use of your personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) point a GDPR.
