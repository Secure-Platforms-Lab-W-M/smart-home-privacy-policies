            <li>In addition to collecting Personal Information, we may collect information that does not identify you and is not associated with your Personal Information.  We may also de-identify information so it no longer identifies you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Ecommerce</h5>
        <p>If you are visiting an e-commerce site, you may be asked to provide enough information to process and fulfill your order.

    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h4>Device Operation</h4>
        <p>In order to fully appreciate all the features of your Hampton device, you may be asked to download our mobile application and set up an account. During this process, we will ask you to create a username and password and provide certain information necessary to establish and use your account, which may include your name, telephone number, physical and email address, and other information to identify and protect you.</p>
        <p>The setup information is collected along with information about your Hampton device, such as device status, logs of those who lock/unlock the device and use our Service, the guests that you invite, and other users of the device. We may store this data along with your other personal information and other information about your use of our Service. We use this information to allow you (and us) to operate and provide support for your device and our Service.</p>
        <p>Our mobile application may track your location using GPS to determine when your mobile device is near your Hampton device (e.g. geofencing). This information will only be stored on your mobile device, and will not be collected and stored in our cloud or servers. If you disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your mobile device, Service functionality, such as the geofencing feature, reminders to lock your doors when you leave your home and asking you if you’d like to unlock your door when you return home, may not work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h4>Other Users</h4>
        <p>As part of our Services, you may grant another user and guest (collectively, “other users”) access to your Hampton device. If you provide other users with access to your Hampton device, certain elements of your information, device, and Service information may be shared with them in order for them to understand the invite and access the device. We may also share their information with you. We may also collect personal information (as required to use our Service as set forth in this Privacy Policy) about the other users to allow them to have access to your Hampton device and Service. All such information (including their Service usage information) is subject to, and will be used and disclosed as set forth in, this Privacy Policy. All users expressly consent to such use and disclosure as a user of our Service. If you are another user or guest and do not consent to such use, do not use the Service.

        <h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
        <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) affords the Californian consumer specific rights regarding personal information. These rights have been described in this policy overall and are further highlighted in this section. If you have a specific question or concern about your rights, or questions about our policy in support of your rights as a Californian consumer, please contact us through our website at www.hampton.care/privacy or by phone at 800-562-5625.</p>
        <p>What is Personal Information under the CCPA?</p>
        <p>“Personal information” is anything that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.</p>
        <p>Your Rights with regard to your Personal Information:</p>
        <p>You have the right as a Californian consumer to expect disclosures as to how we collect, use and care for personal data and we have provided these disclosures in the above sections of our Privacy Notice. </p>
        <p>You can continue to expect us to disclose how we collect personal information and the sources from which we may obtain that information, and the specific personal information or categories of information that we have collected. You have a right to the disclosure of the business or commercial purposes we have for collecting personal information, the legal basis on which we do so, disclosure of the categories of personal information that have been transferred, shared or disclosed in the preceding 12-month period for commercial purposes, and the categories of recipients to which that personal information has been disclosed, shared, or transferred. </p>
        <p>The CCPA requires opt in consent to data use for minors under the age of 16 and verified parental consent for children under the age of 13. If notified that children have provided data without appropriate process and consent, it will be deleted as immediately as practicable on advisement. Lastly, you have the right to ask what information we have about you specifically. </p>
        <p>You may exercise these rights without concern. You cannot be denied benefits or services or charged differently for doing so. We, or our partners, on verification of your identity and legitimate standing to make the request, and if not an undue or unreasonable hardship for the company, shall act on your request, or at a very minimum, advise you as to why we cannot. There are specific reasons under the law which prevent accommodation of some requests, but if denied, we will advise as to why, to whom you may submit a complaint, and your options for challenge, redress or escalation. </p>
        <p><strong>You may make a verifiable request to exercise the following rights, free of charge to you, twice in a 12-month period, and we are obligated to respond within a period of 45 days.  </strong></p>
        <p><strong>You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hamptonproducts.com">privacy@hamptonproducts.com</a>, by phone at 800-562-5625, or by filling out the <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/513a1f7a-de89-474b-8941-8e83d337fcb8">Individual Rights</a> form.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Please note: To protect your privacy, we may ask for additional information to verify your identity in order for us to respond to your request.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Access: </strong>You have the right to request disclosure of the personal information we hold, and to receive additional details regarding the personal information the business collects and its use purposes, including any third parties with which it shares information.  Much of this information is presented in the above sections of the Privacy Notice, as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Delete: </strong>You have the right to request that we erase your personal information and for us to direct the same of any third-party service providers processing your data on our behalf.</p>
        <p><strong>Portability: </strong>Request that any information electronically held be returned in a format permitting its transfer to another service.</p>
        <p><strong>WE DO NOT SELL, DISCLOSE, SHARE OR TRANSFER DATA FOR THE COMMERCIAL BENEFIT OF ANY PARTY. PERSONAL DATA OR THE BENEFIT OF ITS USE IS NEVER PROVIDED IN COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES </strong></p>
        <p>That does not mean that we do not share your data with other parties; but, as described in the above sections of the Privacy Notice, any disclosure of data is solely performed for the operation of the site and provision of services. </p>

        <p><strong>Canada residents</strong></p>
        <p>Your personal information may be sent to the United States for processing and while the information is in the United States it may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities, if required by law. Please be assured that we make every effort to protect the privacy of our Canadian users, including complying with the legal requirements of Canada’s federal privacy law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and similar provincial laws in British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. Under these laws, you have the right to access of your personal information at minimal or no cost, including whether we have your personal information, how it is or has been used, and a list of any third parties to which it has been disclosed.  We are obligated to respond to your request within 30 calendar days, unless your information falls under one of the exemptions listed in the PIPEDA. You can exercise your right to access by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hamptonproducts.com">privacy@hamptonproducts.com</a> or by filling out the <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/513a1f7a-de89-474b-8941-8e83d337fcb8">Individual Rights</a> form.</p>
