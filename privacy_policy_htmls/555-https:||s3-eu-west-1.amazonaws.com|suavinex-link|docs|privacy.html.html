            <li>Lastly,
if we have obtained your data through any external physical form, we
shall no longer store these and shall eliminate your data when the
purposes of the processing vary or when you inform us of your intention
to unsubscribe from the relevant list; however, we undertake to inform
you of your right to cancel your subscription and request the
elimination of your data in each commercial communication we submit. <br>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pursuant

    <h1 class="terms-title">3. Sharing a profile and generating PDF documents<br>
</h1>
      <p>As you will discover once you become familiar with the
various functionalities available on our Application, Suavinex Link
offers you the possibility of sharing all the information about your
profile with a person authorised by you previously.<br>
</p>
<p>In these cases, you are informed that Suavinex shall solely be
responsible for the data stored on the platform, which are processed in
accordance with applicable regulations. Once these data are shared with
third parties or platforms that are unrelated to Suavinex Link, all the
data, contents and information shared are no longer part of our
systems, therefore Suavinex shall not be liable for any actions,
communications and, in general, disclosures carried out in relation to
the information you share. <br>
</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, please be aware of the importance and
sensitive nature of the data associated with your account; we recommend
that you use the sharing and downloading function in a responsible
manner, solely sharing data with third parties you trust and under the
appropriate security and surveillance measures, which you shall be
directly responsible for ensuring as the data controller from then
on.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>This recommendation refers to pdf documents that can be generated
with the Application, and to the downloading of documents and contents
hosted on said Application, therefore, once these are downloaded or
shared outside of the platform managed by Suavinex, this party shall
not be liable with regard to any actions, communications and
disclosures carried out.</p>


    <h1 class="terms-title">4. Invitation to view profile</h1>
      <p>If,
on the other hand, you have received an invitation to view a
third-party profile, in this case, you are informed that the invitation
you receive is carried out with the aim of enabling you to view the
content stored on said profile, with prior express authorisation from
the account titleholder, and you cannot share or use said information
for any other purpose. &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Exclusivas Rimar, SL shall not be liable for the way you use the
information you may access. Please use the information and data you
view in a responsible and sensible manner, and please refrain from
accepting incorrect invitations from third parties that cannot be
clearly identified.</p>


    <h1 class="terms-title">5. Children's personal data<br>
</h1>
      <p>Data concerning children that may be provided for the
purpose of using the Application and therefore included therein, shall
solely be shared by the person holding parental responsibility for the
children and, therefore, with sufficient capacity to give consent for
the minors pursuant to the capacity requirements. <br>
</p>
<p>The statement above is an essential requirement for the correct use
of the application and, therefore, for hosting the personal data of the
children on said Application. </p>


       <h1 class="terms-title"> 6.- Data processing confidentiality and security</h1>
        <p>Suavinex
implements both the technical and organisational security measures
established by existing legislation, in order to guarantee the security
of the personal data, preventing the alteration, loss or any
unauthorised access to or processing of such data. Likewise, Suavinex
undertakes to review the personal data received and to analyse the risk
concerning these, in order to apply the necessary protection measures. <br>
</p>
<p>In this regard, you are hereby informed that the data you submit to
Suavinex by means of Suavinex Link, shall be encrypted and stored on
own servers so nobody can access these without the necessary
credentials. The manner in which each User uses their data, once they
are downloaded on their device, is beyond the scope of the Suavinex
Link platform, and therefore the User is exclusively responsible for
protecting this information. <br>
</p>
<p>You are also informed that any communication between the User’s
device and the servers shall be encrypted by a HTTPS protocol,
therefore no other data shall be able to be obtained except from the
User’s own terminal. <br>
</p>
<p>However, the technical security on a medium such as the Internet is
not impenetrable and there may be filtrations as a result of the
fraudulent actions of third parties, which we undertake to duly combat,
and we will inform you of these if deemed necessary.<br>
</p>
<p>Likewise, as the titleholder of the personal data, please maintain
the appropriate security measures for the purpose of creating a secure
environment when using the application. <br>
</p>
<p>In this regard, please use your username and password coordinates
under strict parameters. In this regard, your username and password
must be chosen at all times with maximum security in mind with regard
to access. If the aforementioned access information is shared, you
shall be responsible for this and it must only be shared with people
your trust and who fulfil the same security requirements in terms of
access and use of the Application and, therefore, with regard to the
use of personal data.<br><br>
