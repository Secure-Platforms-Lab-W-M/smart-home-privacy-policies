                <p>If we cannot verify if you are the California consumer making the request is the consumer about whom we have collected information (or is authorized to act on your behalf) we have the right to deny requests. While verifying your identity we shall generally avoid requesting additional information from you for purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request additional information from you, which shall only be used for the purposes of verifying your identity while you are seeking to exercise your rights under the CCPA, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We shall delete any new personal information collected for the purposes of verification as soon as practical after processing your request, except as required to comply with applicable legislation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>An "Authorized agent" means a natural person or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State that a consumer has authorized to act on your behalf and conditioned you have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Provided the authorized agent written permission to do so and we could verify this; and</p></li>
                    <li><p>Verified your own identity directly with the business.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>Subsection 1 does not apply when you have provided the authorized agent with a valid power of attorney.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We endeavor to timely respond to a verifiable individual, free of charge and in a portable format unless it is excessive, repetitive or material unfounded. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason thereof and extension period in writing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Non-Discrimination</b><br>
                    We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. Unless permitted by applicable regulations, we will not charge different prices or rates, deny products or services, provide different products or services or level of quality and/or suggest you may receive the foregoing mentioned.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your data’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
