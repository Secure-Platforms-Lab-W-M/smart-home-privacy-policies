&nbsp;

<ol>
	<li value="4"><strong>Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies</strong></li>
</ol>
As you navigate through and interact with our Products/Apps/Websites, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your devices, data, equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:

<ul>
	<li>details of your use of and visits to our Products/Apps/Websites, including Product performance data, traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Products/Apps/Website;</li>
	<li>information about your devices, computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type; and</li>
	<li>information about the status, use and household conditions related to connected devices through our Products/Apps/Websites embedded software.</li>
</ul>
We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). See below for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on the Products/Apps/Websites and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking.<br>
The information we collect automatically may include personal information or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information that we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. This practice helps us to improve our Products/Apps/Websites and deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:
<ul>
	<li>estimate our audience size and usage patterns;</li>
	<li>store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Products/Apps/Websites according to your individual interests;</li>
	<li>speed up your searches; and</li>
	<li>recognize you when you return to our Products/Apps/Websites.</li>
</ul>
The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> A cookie is a small file placed on your device or computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Apps/Websites.</li>
	<li><strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> Certain features of our Apps/Websites may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on the Apps/Websites. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see <em>Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages of the Apps/Websites and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs. pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related Websites statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain Websites content and verifying system and server integrity).</li>
	<li><strong>Connected Devices.&nbsp; </strong>By utilizing a connected device, you are agreeing to allow the transfer of the usage data to us for review to assess the usage patterns and performance of the connected device and may allow communications regarding your connected device or household conditions.</li>
</ul>
We may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or you provide to us.<br>
<br>
<strong>Do Not Track.</strong> As discussed above, because we may track Products/Apps/Websites usage information through the use of cookies, pixels and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose data still may be collected for another; and even if one Website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that Website usually will not be able to control other websites.<br>
&nbsp;
<ol>

We reserve the right not to satisfy such a verifiable request from the same consumer more than twice in a 12-month period.
