<p><strong>Privacy Statement</strong>
</p>
<p>
Thinka BV processes personal data within the framework of purchasing and / or using the Thinka for KNX (hereafter Thinka Box). We need the data we process for, among other things, supplying the Thinka and updating it and for being able to provide the service for which the Thinka is intended.
</p>
<p>
In this privacy statement we inform you about which data we process, what we do with that information and why, and what your rights are in that respect.
</p>
<h2>Purchase</h2>


<p>
If you order a Thinka Box from us, we process your name and address, e-mail address and payment details.
</p>
<p>
The processing of this personal data is necessary for the execution of the shipping of the Thinka Box. We keep this information for as long as necessary for the execution of the agreement.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we will process the payment details and the information stated on the invoice to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us. We keep this information during the term of the agreement and the term for the fiscal retention.
</p>
<p>
We share this data with our logistics partners Jortt, DHL and / or MyParcel.
</p>
<p>
Your name and e-mail address will be used to keep you informed of the shipment and to send you help with the installation of the Thinka Box.
</p>
<h2>Registration and account</h2>


<p>
For the use of the Thinka Box, regardless of who you bought it from, it is <strong>desirable</strong> that you register your Thinka Box. Then, and only then, do we process the serial number of your Thinka Box and your IP address. Your Thinka Box will then periodically contact our servers to verify the legitimate use of the software and to check whether updates to the software are available and to install them. Without registration, the Thinka Box will function completely, but will receive no updates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Optionally</strong> , you can state a name and e-mail address when registering. This name and this e-mail address can be used by us to proactively contact us for support purposes.
</p>
<p>
We can share this support data with our partner Zendesk.
</p>
<h2>Use</h2>


<p>
The Thinka Box has a link with your home automation system (KNX), and makes it possible to control (a selection of) the devices in the installation. This is all done indoors and goes via the wired KNX network or (optionally) via the LAN via a KNX IP Gateway.
</p>
<p>
The link to the home automation installation can be simplified by reading in an ETS (KNX programming) file. Reading and processing this file (privacy sensitive data about the design of your house) is done exclusively on the Thinka Box and will never be read by us.
</p>
<p>
Operating the Thinka Box with HomeKit is also all local and does not leave the home network. When operating the Thinka Box via a HomeHub from Apple, the security by Apple is controlled through hardware encryption in the iOS device and the Thinka Box.
</p>
<h2>Voice control</h2>


<p>
If you use Siri to operate the Thinka Box, your iOS device will contact Apple for the translation of a voice command to a HomeKit instruction, this translation requires Internet access, but the Thinka does not know about it. The Thinka Box only executes the HomeKit instructions from the iOS device locally.
</p>
<p>
Voice control with Amazon or Google requires a connection from the Thinka Box to the Internet. The assignments are initiated from the Amazon and Google Cloud environment respectively. The Thinka Box has a secure connection with Thinka Cloud and processes the assignments of Alexa or Google Home. These commands may contain information about the devices connected to Thinka Box in your home. Thinka Cloud receives no speech, only the "switch commands". Thinka Box will also be able to report status changes in home automation to Alexa and / or Google. Alexa and / or Google will also periodically request the status of the Thinka Box and the link to the home automation installation.
</p>
<p>
We keep these received data and orders a maximum of one week for support and possible improvement of our service. However, we have no control over the processing by the provider you have chosen. For information on this, we refer you to the privacy statement of the relevant provider.
</p>
<p>
This processing is necessary for the execution of the agreement between you and us (providing the interface function). In addition, the use of the Thinka Box means that you give us permission for this.
</p>
<h2>Support</h2>


<p>
Optionally, the Thinka Box offers users support in the form of backup and restore of your configuration, as well as the creation and sending of diagnostic information. Both are on the initiative of you, the user. The data is encrypted and can only be read by Thinka support. Furthermore, we offer the possibility to protect the web interface (which is only accessible on the LAN) with a password on the Thinka Box. Thinka BV does not have access to this password.
</p>
<p>
In rare cases, a user can give Thinka BV support access to his or her Thinka Box through an opening in the user's firewall. Only a Thinka support employee can gain access through a secure connection and a private key.
