<h2>10.3 Use Separate Logins for Webshop and App</h2>
<p>Please note that the Smappee Webshop (www.smappee.com) uses a different login than the Smappee App and the Dashboard (pro.smappee.net):</p>
<ul>

However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<h2>11.7 The right to complain to a supervisory authority</h2>
<p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
<h2>11.8 The right to withdraw consent</h2>
<p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
