<p>We take the protection of your privacy and your personal data very seriously. Therefore, we only process your personal data in accordance with the content of this privacy policy and the GDPR.</p>

<p>The objective of this Privacy Policy is to inform you, which personal data we process in our online and mobile offers about you, for what purpose this happens and according to which legal basis this processing is permitted.</p>

<h3>Data Protection Officer</h3>

<p>You can reach our Data Protection Officer at:</p>

<p><span style="background-attachment:initial; background-clip:initial; background-image:initial; background-origin:initial; background-position:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-size:initial"><a href="mailto:datenschutz@miele.de">datenschutz@miele.de</a></span></p>

<h3>Personal data</h3>

<p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person;&nbsp;a natural person is considered as being identifiable, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more special characteristics expressing the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person can be identified. This includes all information about your identity such as your name, your e-mail address or postal address, your customer number and online identifiers. Information that cannot be linked to your identity (such as the number of online users), on the other hand, is not personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>You can use our online and mobile offers without revealing your identity and without providing any personal data. When using our online shop, the BlueHorizon portal, the apps and some services of the Miele website and the apps, however, collect your personal information.</p>

<h3>Storage of personal data</h3>

<p>Your data will be stored by us on specially protected servers. These are protected by technical and organisational measures against loss, destruction, access, modification or dissemination of your data by unauthorised persons. Access to your data is only possible for a few authorised persons. These are responsible for the technical, commercial or editorial support of the servers.</p>

<p>Your personal data is encrypted and transmitted over the Internet. We use SSL encryption (Secure Socket Layer) for data transmission.</p>

<h3>Legal basis of data processing</h3>

<p>Insofar as we obtain consent for the processing of your personal data, Art. 6(1) lit. (a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing.</p>

<p>Insofar as your personal data is processed because this is necessary to fulfil a contract or in the context of a contract-like relationship with you, Art. 6(1) lit.&nbsp;(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing.</p>

<p>Insofar as we process your personal data in order to fulfil a legal obligation, Art. 6(1) lit.&nbsp;(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing.</p>

<p>As a legal basis for the data processing, Art. 6(1) lit.&nbsp;(f) GDPR applies if the processing of your personal data is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party and your interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not require the protection of your personal data.</p>

<p>As part of this Privacy Policy, we will always state the legal basis on which we base the processing of your personal data.</p>

<h3>Destruction of data and storage duration</h3>

<p>We always delete or block your personal data whenever the purpose of the storage is omitted. However, it can also be stored if this is provided for by the legal requirements to which we are subject, for example with regard to statutory retention and documentation obligations. In such a case, we will delete or block your personal data after the end of the respective requirements.</p>

<h2>Data processing with general use of our offers</h2>

<h3>Information about the usage and communication device you are using</h3>

<p>Each time you access our online and mobile offers, we collect the following information about the device you are using: the IP address, the request from your browser, and the date and time of this request. In addition, the status and the amount of data transferred are recorded as part of this request. We also collect product and version information about the browser used and the operating system of the device, as well as the Internet service provider. We continue to track which website accessed the service.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the processing of this data is Art.&nbsp;6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>

<p>We process this data so that the content, for example the website, can be displayed on your device. In addition, we use the data for the operation of the online and mobile services and to detect and eliminate errors, to determine the utilisation of the online and mobile services and to make adjustments or improvements.</p>

<p>At the same time, these purposes justify the legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p>The IP address of your device will be stored only for the time of use of the online or mobile offer and then deleted or shortened. The data is stored for a limited period of time.</p>

<h3>Use of cookies</h3>

<p>We use cookies. These are small text files that are stored on your computer and that store certain settings and data for sharing with us online about your browser. A cookie usually contains the name of the domain from which the cookie file was sent, as well as information about the age of the cookie and an alphanumeric identifier. Depending on content and storage duration, there are different types of cookies. Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies", which are deleted when you end your browser session. In addition, there are some long-lasting cookies by which we are able to recognise you as a visitor. Many cookies come directly from us, in addition, the storage and evaluation of individual cookies come from service providers (so-called "third-party cookies").</p>

<p>We inform you about the use of cookies in advance with a corresponding note on a banner.</p>

<p>Some cookies are technically required in order to enable you to use our online and mobile services. These cookies allow us to collect and store the following data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Language settings</li>
	<li>Search settings</li>
	<li>Contents of an online form</li>
	<li>Information for identifying or authenticating the user</li>
	<li>Products in the shopping cart</li>
	<li>Products on the notepad</li>
	<li>Products from the purchase consultant</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, on our website, we use cookies that allow an analysis of your user behaviour, so-called analysis cookies. These cookies allow us to collect and store the following data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Frequency of page views</li>
	<li>Searches</li>
	<li>Use of Internet page functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Your data collected by means of cookies are pseudonymised so that the data cannot be matched to the respective user.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the processing of data by means of cookies is Art.&nbsp;6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>

<p>Cookies allow us to recognise your computer and make any presets available immediately. Cookies help us to improve the online offer and offer you a better and more user-friendly service. The use of cookies is necessary to make the use of our online offers easier. Some features can only be offered through the use of cookies. This concerns the search, online forms, customer account, shopping cart and notepad.</p>

<p>We use analysis cookies to improve and optimise the quality of our online offers and their content.</p>

<p>At the same time, these purposes justify the legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p>The technically necessary cookies we use are so-called session cookies, which are automatically deleted after the end of the browser session. The remaining cookies are stored on your computer. You can delete these saved cookies yourself at any time. Most browsers are also set to automatically accept cookies. However, you can disable the storage of cookies or set your browser to notify you when cookies are sent. Please note that you may be limited or unable to use our online service if you refuse to accept cookies.</p>

<p>To analyse the user behaviour for the purposes mentioned above, we use the following programs, which in turn use cookies as explained. The stored data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for the purposes mentioned.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>We use Google Analytics for statistical analysis. Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94034, USA ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be shortened by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and Internet usage to the website operator. The IP address provided by Google Analytics as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. You can prevent the storage of cookies by using a corresponding setting on your browser software; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all the features of this website to the fullest extent possible. In addition, you may prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de/" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.</a><br>
For more information, see <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de/" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a> (general information about Google Analytics and privacy). We point out that on our website Google Analytics was extended under the code "anonymizeIp ();"&nbsp;in order to anonymise the IP addresses, whereby the last octet is deleted.</p>

<h3>Retargeting and Remarketing</h3>

<p>Retargeting or remarketing refers to technologies in which users who have previously visited a certain website are shown appropriate advertising even after leaving this website. For this purpose, it is necessary to recognise Internet users beyond their own website, for which purpose cookies of the corresponding service providers are used. In addition, the previous usage behaviour is considered. For example, if a user views certain products, they may later display these or similar products as advertisements on other websites. It is personalised advertising that is adapted to the needs of each user. It is not necessary for this personalised advertisement to be identified beyond the recognition of the user. The data used for the retargeting or remarketing will therefore not be merged with other data.</p>

<p>We use such technologies to display ads on the Internet. We use third-party providers to deliver such ads. We use, among other things, offers from Google, which allows an automatic display of interesting products for the Internet user. This function is implemented by cookies. For more information about this technology,&nbsp;see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?gl=de" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial; text-decoration-style:initial">Google Privacy Policy</span></a> under <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a>: The installation of cookies for Google Remarketing and Google AdWords Conversion Tracking can be prevented by setting the respective browser software by accessing the website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a> and changing the corresponding setting.</p>

<p>The site uses Google Retargeting Tags, Appnexus and Performance Profiles to promote Miele products. The retargeting JavaScript codes implemented on this website store a cookie on the user's computer for the purpose of retargeting. At a later date, the user will be provided with Miele banners or text ads, provided that the user acts on Google Search websites as well as Google's Display Networks, Appnexus and Performance Profiles. All data is recorded anonymously so that it is not possible to draw any conclusions about specific persons. Users can opt out of retargeting functionality by modifying the Google Remarketing Tags display or disabling retargeting. Alternatively, users may disable the use of third-party cookies by using the network advertising initiative's opt-out page or object to each network individually.</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>You can register as a user in our online and mobile offers. To do this you must enter the data requested, for example name, address and e-mail address. We also record the date and time of registration and the IP address. As part of the registration process, we obtain your consent regarding the use of the data.</p>

<p>The legal basis for the processing of data for registration is Art.&nbsp;6(1)(a) GDPR. Insofar as you register for the fulfilment or initiation of a contract with us, the legal basis for the processing of the data is additionally Art.&nbsp;6(1)(b) GDPR.</p>

<p>Registration is required to fulfil or initiate a contract with us for certain services.</p>

<p>The data will be stored by us for as long as necessary to fulfil the contract. In addition, we store this data for the fulfilment of post-contractual obligations and due to commercial and tax retention periods for the statutory period. This retention period is usually 10 years at the end of the respective calendar year.</p>
