INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2><h3 id="1.1">1.1 Information you provide us directly:</h3><p><strong>Your username, password and email address when you register for a Petcube account.</strong><br>This information is vital to be able to access your profile with Petcube and use our Service, and it is kept as long as you are using our Service. Your password is one way encrypted. It is your responsibility to keep the password secured and change it at least once per 3 months. Never share your password with anyone. We encourage you to use</p><p><strong>Profile information you provide for your user or pet profiles.</strong><br>Profile information including, but not limited to first and last name, profile picture, location with granularity to the city name, birthday, gender, your pet(s) name(s), and breed(s). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Petcube. This information is provided by you optionally to improve your experience with our Service. You can always change or delete it entirely by logging into your profile page on petcube.com or with our apps for iOS or Android.</p><p><strong>User Content (e.g., photos, audio, videos, comments, likes) that you post to the Service</strong><br>Please refer to more detailed <a href="#9">Section 9</a></p><p><strong>Communications between you and Petcube</strong><br>For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., data collection and processing requests, account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).

Petcube does not store this information, it is encrypted and sent to our payment processor. We keep only the last four digits of your credit card and card type for identification purposes. Our payment processor works in compliance with GDPR and PIPEDA.</p><p><strong>Information from your accounts with Facebook and Instagram</strong><br>We store your name, age, gender and location if you connect those to your profile for easier login and if you want to post some of your content from our app to these social networks. Please refer to Section 7 for a more detailed explanation.</p><p><strong>Replies to all surveys that you participate in</strong><br>Answers are stored in a pseudonymized way with a 3rd party services provider (SurveyMonkey), and we do not have the ability to link any of your replies to your user profile or identify you in any way. Answers to a survey may contain your name and/or email as a part of responses to surveys to be able to provide you with a prize for participation in respective surveys, but you not obligated to provide them anyway.

Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled. The information we collect and share under this purpose is pseudonymized.</p><p><strong>Metadata:</strong><br>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User-Generated Content.
