Wink can (and you authorize Wink to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement agencies or government officials, as Wink, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, or as otherwise required by law. The Company may share general, demographic, or aggregated information with third parties about its Users and their Content and Services usage, but that information will not include or be linked to any Personally Identifiable Information without your consent.</p><p><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Wink takes the security of your Personally Identifiable Information very seriously, and follows generally accepted industry standards for the protection of the Personally Identifiable Information that you submit, both during transmission and after receipt. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we do not guarantee the security of any of your private transmissions against unauthorized or unlawful interception or access by third parties.</p><p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>The Personally Identifiable Information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Wink’s latest product announcements, software updates, new features, and upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from Wink, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.</p><p>We also use Personally Identifiable Information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.</p><p>We may use your Personally Identifiable Information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use your date of birth to determine your eligibility to make a purchase on the Site or to use Wink services.</p><p>From time to time, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to send important notices about Wink, such as communications about purchases, changes to our terms and conditions, or Wink service-related issues. Because this information is important to your interaction with Wink and the Wink service, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</p><p>We may also use Personally Identifiable Information for internal purposes, such as data analysis, understanding our user base, auditing, and research to improve Wink’s products, services and customer relations.</p><p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We also collect data that is not Personally Identifiable Information. That is, data that is in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p><p>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and time zone where you access the Wink app so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services and advertising.</p><p>We may collect information regarding your activities through use of the Wink app or Wink Relay, and from our partner products.

This information may be used to improve our services, and provide additional services.</p><p><strong>RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We may keep the information that we obtain from or about you as long as is permitted or required under the law, and use as authorized under this Privacy Policy. We may use retained data to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services or to comply with legal obligations. Information may exist in backup storage even after it has been removed from our active databases. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that differ from United States law, please note that we may transfer information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. By using the Services you consent to the transfer of information to the United States or to any country in which Wink maintains facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Agreement.</p><p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p><p>Wink’s website, services, the Wink App, email messages and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.
