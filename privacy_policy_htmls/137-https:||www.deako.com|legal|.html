This Policy applies to the User Data that is collected from you when you use the Service and all other data or information that becomes associated with your Account via your use of the Service. By visiting, accessing, downloading, or using the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, storage, transfer, processing, and disclosure of your information, including personal information and User Data, as described in this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, DO NOT ACCESS, USE, OR DOWNLOAD ANY PART OF THE SERVICE, REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT, MAKE A PURCHASE ON THE SITE, OR CLICK TO INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE WITH THIS POLICY. This Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms of Service (“Terms”) governing your use of the Service. Parts of the Terms affect this Policy, so be sure to review the Terms prior to using any part of the Service. Capitalized terms not defined herein have the definitions set forth in the Terms.<br><br>1. APPLICABILITY OF THIS POLICY. This Policy covers our treatment of information that is collected by us or submitted by you in relation to your use of the Service, including automatically collected non-personally identifiable information, personally identifiable information, User Data, and User Content. When you visit the Service without registering for an Account, you can browse without submitting any personally identifiable information. In order to set up an Account and use the Service, however, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, home address, billing address, and telephone number. This Policy does not apply to information collected by third parties, including our third party payment processor or any Linked Sites. We have no control over, and no responsibility or liability for any third party collection, use, disclosure, or retention of your information and that collection, use, disclosure, and retention is not subject to this Policy. Be sure to review the privacy policies of any Linked Sites or other third party services you may access.<br><br>2. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY. Deako reserves the right to revise this Policy from time to time by updating it and posting it at: www.deako.com/privacy with the revised Policy taking effect on the date of Posting. You should review this Policy from time to time so you are familiar with the most current version. Your use of the Service after the Effective Date posted above will constitute your acceptance of the updated Policy.<br><br>3. INFORMATION COLLECTION. We collect the following types of information:<br>* Account, Login, Purchase, and Shipping Information. If you create an Account on the Site or Application or pre-order or purchase any Products from Deako using the Site, you will be asked to provide some personal information about yourself, including, but not limited to, your first and last name, your email address, your shipping address, your phone number, credit card information, the names and addresses to whom purchases are shipped (if applicable).<br>* Email Address Collection. You may provide your email address to us in order to receive updates related to Deako products and services even if you do not sign up for an Account or make a purchase. In addition to updates about Deako products and services, we may use your email address to send you newsletters, promotions, or advertisements that we think may be of interest to you. If you would like to stop receiving promotional messages from us or third parties, please click on the opt-out link in any non-Service related email you receive.<br>* Information Collected by Products; User Data. If you purchase and use any Products with the Service, including, but not limited to, switches, dimmers, WiFi Bridge (“Products”), we will collect some information related to your use of the Products, including, but not limited to: information collected during Product setup, such as information about the exact address where the Product will be used or the location within your home where Products will be used; times and dates of usage; and technical information from the Products, such as Product model, serial number or software version, Product status, Product settings, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity or signal strength, scenes, usage statistics, and use of system and Application software (all collectively, “User Data”). The collection and use of your User Data allows Deako to track use of the Products; send notifications to you about your Products; and to otherwise provide the Service to you. If you have multiple Products, your User Data may be shared between those Products. For example, User Data concerning usage statistics may be transmitted between the Products in your home and your mobile device or Deako’s servers. As soon as you connect the Products to your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network, the Product will regularly collect and send your User Data to Deako. We will store your User Data indefinitely and in a profile specific to you and some User Data may be stored directly on Products.<br>* Location Data. Certain features available in the Service may allow or require us to obtain your location information, including GPS coordinates in real time (“GPS Location”). Your GPS Location may allow us to locate you with a high degree of precision. If the Service is unable to acquire your GPS Location, certain features of the Service may not be available to you. We may collect and use GPS Location information over time to offer you services or to protect, enhance, or update the Service.<br>* Support Requests or Communications Submitted by You. Any personal communications that you or a third party voluntarily submits to us in any format, including by email, postal mail, or any other method of communication may be collected and saved indefinitely in a profile specific to you.<br>* Automatically Collected Information. Similar to other web sites and mobile applications, we may collect some information automatically and store it in log files. We may use Google Analytics or other third party analytics providers to collect this information about the Service. This information does not identify you. This collection may include, but is not limited to: your IP address, browser type and language, device type, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of each request you make. We collect this non-identifying information in order to better understand our customer base, to more efficiently operate our business, to promote our products and services, and to improve the quality of the Service. We do not link analytics information with any of your personally identifiable information, or User Data. We may automatically collect information using various mechanisms, including but not limited to: Cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a computer for record-keeping purposes. Our third-party analytics providers use cookies to record information about your activities while using the Service and to “remember” you when you return to the Service. Some cookies remain on your computer until you delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your browser. You may set your browser setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Service. See the section entitled “Do-Not Track Settings” below for more information on how the Service may respond to your browser settings. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.  Pixels (aka web beacons/web bugs/java script). Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails. Our third-party analytics providers may place pixels on the Site that track what other websites you visit (both before and after visiting the Site). Our third-party analytics providers use information obtained from pixels to help us improve our business and the Service. We do not control the use of pixels by third parties.  Google Analytics uses cookies and pixels in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Service, including but not limited to information about the pages where users enter and exit the Site and what pages users view on the Site, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies and pixels allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Site and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Site and other websites to share with us and other website operators information about users including, but not limited to, age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information, or User Data. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies, pixels, and collection and use of information, please review Google’s Privacy Policy. If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the following link: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on<br>* Payment Information; Third-Party Payment Processor. Credit card payments, including recurring charges, are handled through our third party payment processor. Our third party payment processor will collect and may retain your credit card information in order to process your payment, including payment for your purchases of Products or for recurring annual Service charges. We do not control the third party collection, use, disclosure, or retention of your information. Pease review our third party payment processor’s privacy policy and terms of use prior to submitting your payment information. Also see the “Affiliated Entities and Service Providers” section below.<br><br>4. INFORMATION USE.<br>* General. We will use your personally identifiable information to operate, manage and administer your Account and the Service; to fulfill your orders for Products; to provide you with support or a more personalized experience; to communicate with you; to monitor Service usage; to improve the Service or Products and to develop and test new products, services, websites, or applications; to match interests; to provide you information about products and services (including the products and services of third parties); to resolve disputes; to detect and protect against errors, fraud, and illegal activity; to assist law enforcement; to enforce this Policy and the Terms; to measure consumer interest; or for any other purpose described in this Policy or described to you at the time of collection.<br>* Communications. We may use your personally identifiable information to send you emails, notifications, text messages, or other communications related to your use of the Service, your Account, your orders for Products; or to respond to your inquiries or requests. You may not opt-out of Service-related emails which are not promotional in nature. We may also send you promotional emails to notify you about products or services that may be of interest to you. If you would like to stop receiving promotional messages from us or third parties, please click on the opt-out link in any non-Service related email you receive. If you opt-out, you will continue to receive Service-related communications from us.<br>* Use of Non-Personally Identifiable and Aggregate Information. We may use non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, analysing trends, managing and administering the Service, tracking users’ movements, to create new products or services, for research purposes, or to improve our business and the Service. We may also share aggregate information with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising and to analyze and report on the advertising you see. In addition, we may share aggregate statistical information with our business partners. We may also combine your non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information with other non-personally identifiable information and aggregate information collected from other sources. Aggregate information will not be connected with your personally-identifiable information.<br><br>5. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE.<br>* Affiliated Entities and Service Providers. We may disclose your information, including personal information, to any affiliated entity or organization, business partner, and to agents and service providers to help us operate the Service, improve our business or the Service, to provide services to us. These third parties may include customer service providers, business or sales service providers, or providers that provide support for the Service. Use of information by affiliated entities and service providers will be subject to this Policy or an agreement at least as restrictive as this Policy. We will not share your personal information for marketing purposes or with other third parties for purposes unrelated to the Service without your explicit consent.<br>* Legal Requirements. In some cases, we may disclose your information, including personal information, User Content, or User Data (i) as required by any applicable law or legal regulation; (ii) if we believe disclosure is needed to protect our rights, property, or safety; (iii) to government regulators or law enforcement authorities in connection with any judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us or the Service; and (iv) to respond to a physical threat to you or another person.<br>* Insolvency and Business Transitions. If we should ever file for bankruptcy or engage in a business transition such as a merger with another company, or if we purchase, sell, or reorganize all or part of our business or assets, we may disclose your information, including personal information, User Content, and User Data, to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.<br>* Aggregate Information. We may share aggregate information with our affiliated entities and service providers, business partners, or with other third parties or the general public. We may publish information about usage statistics and trends and connect this information with certain demographic information. We may disclose this information in order to contribute to research, or to improve the Service and Products. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that aggregate information is never associated with you or your personal information.<br>* Disclaimer. We cannot ensure that all of your personal information and User Data will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, a third party may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or other users of the Service may abuse or misuse your personal information or User Data. No transmission of data over the internet can be 100% secure.<br><br>6. INFORMATION RETENTION. We may retain your information (including personally identifiable information and User Data) indefinitely, or as long as legally required or allowed, for our business needs and in order to deter fraud, abuse or a breach of our contract. By accessing, using, or registering for the Service, you consent to our information retention practices. If you cancel your Account or your Account is otherwise terminated, we may, but are not obligated to, delete any information we have collected or obtained from you or third parties and we may continue to store, use, and disclose that information in accordance with this Policy. Deako does not undertake any retention obligations through this statement.<br><br>7. INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES. Keeping your information secure is of great concern to us. We exercise care in facilitating the transmission of information between your device or computer, the Products, and the third party servers that operate and store information for the Service. The personal information and User Data we collect is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public. While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information and User Data once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.<br><br>8. “DO NOT TRACK” SETTINGS. Because we track Service usage information through the use of cookies, pixels and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose, data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.<br><br>9. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY.<br>* The Service is not for or Directed Towards Children. You must be 18 years of age or older to use the Service. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from registering for an Account and we will never knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information immediately and delete it from our servers. If you believe information from a child under the age of 13 has been provided to the Service, please notify us at: privacy@deako.com.<br>* California Minors. The Service is not available to users under age 18. If you are a California resident under age 18 and you believe your information has become publicly-available in the Service and you are unable to remove it, you may request removal by contacting us at: privacy@deako.com.

References to “you” and “your” mean any person or legal entity that visits, accesses, browses, downloads, or uses the Service, registers for an Account, or makes a purchase through the Service. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, our Limited Warranty, and any additional terms that may be provided or presented to you when you use certain features of the Service or include in-box with Products, all of which are incorporated into these Terms by this reference. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING “I AGREE” AND/OR ACCESSING, USING, DOWNLOADING, OR VISITING THE SERVICE, OR MAKING A PURCHASE THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. THESE TERMS APPLY TO ALL RESIDENTS, VISITORS, REGISTERED USERS, AND OTHERS WHO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT VISIT, ACCESS, OR USE THE PLATFORM, REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT, MAKE A PURCHASE THROUGH THE SERVICE, OR CLICK TO INDICATE THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER; PLEASE REVIEW SECTION 25.<br><br>1. ELIGIBILITY. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, and have the right, authority, and capacity to accept and agree to these Terms. If you are under age 18 or are otherwise unable to accept and agree to these Terms, you may not use or access the Service. If we discover or have any reason to suspect that you are not at least 18 years of age or otherwise unable to accept and agree to these Terms, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service immediately and without notice.<br><br>2. SERVICE. Deako may offer Products for sale as part of the Service. In order to use such Products, you may need to create an Account and access that Account as set forth in Section 4 of these Terms, below.<br>* Product Purchases; Shipping. All sales are FOB shipment origin. Risk of loss passes to you upon shipment of the product from our facilities, and the occurrence of any damage during shipment will not relieve you from making payment of the balance of the purchase price. Prices for Products do not include shipping costs. Our delivery charges and methods are as described on the Site from time to time. Refused deliveries will be returned to Deako.<br>* Product Prices and Availability; Cancellation. Current prices for Products are described on the Site. Deako may change pricing at any time and in its sole discretion, but changes will not affect any order for Products you have already placed. The amount of any sales, use, or other taxes however designated, levied or based on such prices shall be added to the prices shown. Promotions and/or discounts may be offered from time to time on the Site and may be subject to additional terms, limitations, and restrictions. In order to take advantage of such promotions and/or discounts, you agree to comply with any additional terms, conditions, limitations, or rules presented to you as a condition of participation in any such promotional offer. Deako reserves the right to change or discontinue any product or service at any time and without notice. Deako further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any order, limit any purchase, or refuse to fulfill an order for any or no reason. If your order will be cancelled, limited, or delayed, Deako will contact you.<br>* Pre-Orders. Your placement of a pre-order does not create a contract for sale for a Product not offered for sale by Deako. By placing a pre-order for a Product that is not yet available for sale, you make an offer to Deako to purchase the Product subject to these Terms. Deako will obtain an authorization from your bank or payment card company at no charge. An authorization from your payment card company may stay open for several days or weeks before a charge is actually made. You may cancel your offer to purchase the Product at any time prior to shipment and you will not be charged. When the Product is offered for sale, Deako may accept your offer to purchase Products subject to these Terms. At that time, Deako will capture payment on the payment card you provided and ship your Product. Deako may obtain an additional authorization from your payment card company to confirm necessary funds are available to purchase the Products requested.<br>* Payments. You may make payment for Products through the Service using a payment card or other payment method accepted by our third party payment processor. All credit card details are encrypted when entered and stored by our third party payment processor. Deako does not access or store your credit card information and we do not manually accept credit cards for security reasons. You should review the terms of use and privacy policy of our third party payment processor prior to submitting your payment information. For more information about our use of third party service providers, please review our Privacy Policy.<br>* Returns. It is your responsibility to assure the quality of all goods upon receipt. If you are the original purchaser of a Product and you are not satisfied with the Product for any reason, you may return the Product within 30 days of the original purchase date and receive a full refund. If you do not return the Product within 30 days of the original purchase date, you will not be eligible for a refund. To initiate a return, please email support@deako.com or call 1-844-673-3256. You will be responsible for all costs (including shipping costs) associated with returning the Product to Deako. If you request we ship you a replacement Product before we receive the original Product, and you do not return the original Product within 30 days of us shipping the replacement Product, you will be charged for the replacement Product. We may reduce the amount of your refund to reflect any reduction in the value of the returned Product, as determined in our sole discretion, caused by your handling them in a way which goes beyond what is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics, and functioning. If you purchased the Products from somewhere other than Deako, please contact the reseller to return the Products.<br>* Compatibility. Deako is not responsible for the compatibility of the Products with your property, the specific locations in which you intend to use the Products, with other equipment in your property, the electrical wiring box of your property or the power grid. Prior to making a purchase, you should determine whether the Products will be compatible with your property. You must also confirm that the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth service available in your property is sufficient to support the use of the Products. You accept that lack of compatibility is not a valid claim under the warranty provided with our Products and does not otherwise constitute a basis for receiving a refund after the 30-day return policy described above.<br>* Transfer and Resale. Deako does not limit the transfer of Products between locations or individuals and does not restrict the resale of Products. You may take your Products with you when you move or move your Products within your property, at any time. Transfer or resale may, however, require account changes, activation of a new account, or activation of additional accounts and Deako does not guarantee that the Products will remain functional if they are transferred to a new location or to a new user. Transfer of ownership does not extend or expand Deako's limited product warranty.<br><br>3. LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTY. Our product warranty can be found at www.deako.com/limited-warranty.<br><br>4.

Deako, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any intellectual property infringement claim attributable to the Application. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary hereof.<br><br>29. GENERAL. Section titles are only for convenience and have no legal or contractual significance. Any list of examples following "including" or "e.g.," is illustrative and not exhaustive, unless qualified by terms like "only" or "solely." Deako's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its rights to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. A waiver will only be binding on Deako if it is in a written document signed by Deako. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining terms, covenants and restrictions will remain in full force and effect. You and Deako intend that the provisions of these Terms be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Accordingly, you and Deako agree that if any provision is deemed unenforceable, where possible, it will be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, which may include its deletion. Deako may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense your rights (if any). These Terms will be binding upon Deako's successors and assigns. These Terms (including any incorporated terms), and any additional terms provided with any updates, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Deako with respect to the Service. Both you and Deako warrant to each other that, in entering this agreement, neither Deako nor you have relied on nor will have any right or remedy based upon any statement, representation, warranty, or assurance other than those expressly stated in these Terms. The preceding sentence will not limit or exclude any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law. No one other than you and Deako, or Deako's successors and permitted assigns, will have any right to enforce these Terms.<br><br>30. CONTACT INFORMATION. If you have questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the Service, Products, Application, your Account, or these Terms, please contact us at: support@deako.com.</div>    </div>

        <div id="4oCLl" class="   " style=""><strong>A. LIMITED WARRANTY.</strong> Deako warrants that Products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of 1 year (or 6 months for factory refurbished products) from the date of delivery following the original retail purchase (the "Warranty Period"). If the Product fails to conform to this limited warranty during the Warranty Period, Deako will, at its sole discretion, either (A) repair or replace any defective Product or component; or (B) accept the return of the Product and refund the price actually paid by the original purchaser for the Product. Repair or replacement may be made with a new or refurbished product or components, at Deako's sole discretion. If the Product or a component incorporated within it is no longer available, Deako may replace the Product with a similar product of similar function, at Deako's sole discretion. This is your sole and exclusive remedy for breach of this Limited Warranty. Any Product that has either been repaired or replaced under this Limited Warranty will be covered by the terms of this Limited Warranty for the longer of 45 days from the date of delivery or the remaining Warranty Period. This Limited Warranty is transferable from the original purchaser to subsequent owners, but the Warranty Period will not be extended in duration or expanded in coverage for any such transfer.<br><br>B. EXCLUSIONS. This limited warranty does not cover the following Products (collectively "Ineligible Products"): Products marked as "sample" or sold "AS IS;" or Products that have been subject to: (A) modifications, alterations, tampering, or improper maintenance or repairs; (B) handling, storage, installation, testing, or use not in accordance with the User's Guide or other instructions provided by Deako; (C) abuse or misuse; (D) breakdowns, fluctuations, or interruptions in electric power or the telecommunications network; or (E) Acts of God, including lightning, flood, tornado, earthquake, or hurricane. This limited warranty does not cover consumable parts, including batteries, unless damage is due to defects in materials or workmanship of the Product, or software (even if packaged or sold with the product). Deako recommends that you use only authorized service providers for maintenance or repair. Unauthorized use of the Product or software can impair the Product's performance and may invalidate this limited warranty.<br><br><strong>C. WARRANTY CONDITIONS; CLAIMS PROCESS.</strong> Before being able to claim under this limited warranty, the owner of the Product must (A) notify Deako of the intention to claim by warranty@deako.com during the Warranty Period and providing a description of the alleged Product failure, and (B) comply with Deako’s return shipping instructions (postage pre-paid). Deako will have no warranty obligations with respect to a returned Product if it determines, in its reasonable discretion after examination of the returned Product, that the Product is an Ineligible Product (defined above). Deako will bear all costs of return shipping to owner, except with respect to any Ineligible Product, for which owner will bear all shipping costs.<br><br><strong>D. VARIATIONS THAT MAY APPLY TO THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so some of the exclusions and limitations set forth above may not apply to you. Nothing in this Section 3 will be interpreted as limiting an implied warranty which cannot under applicable law be limited in those jurisdictions. If you reside, or are otherwise subject to the laws in one of those jurisdictions, the limitations in this Section 3 may not apply to you. For a full description of your legal rights, you should refer to the laws applicable in your jurisdiction and you may wish to contact a relevant consumer advisory service.</div>    </div>
