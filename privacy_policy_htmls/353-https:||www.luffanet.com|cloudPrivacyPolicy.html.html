    </div>
    <div>Collection and Use of
Personal Information<br>
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a
single person.<br>
You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are
in contact with Luffanet or an Luffanet affiliated company. Luffanet
and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other
and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine
it with other information to provide and improve our products,
services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the
personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to
do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our
products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<br>
<br>
How we use your personal information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also use personal information to help us create,
develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also use personal information for internal
purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve
Luffanet’s products, services, and customer communications.<br>
<br>
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information<br>
We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct
association with any specific individual. We may collect, use,
transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The
following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect
and how we may use it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may collect information location, and the time
zone where an Luffanet product is used so that we can better understand
customer behavior and improve our products, services.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may collect information regarding customer
activities and from our other products and services. This information
is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to
our customers and to understand which parts of our devices, products,
and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non
personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may collect and store details of how you use our
services, including search queries. This information may be used to
improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in
limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet,
such information will not be associated with your IP address.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your explicit consent, we may collect data
about how you use your device and applications in order to help app
developers improve their apps.<br>
If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the
combined information will be treated as personal information for as
long as it remains combined.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cookies and Other Technologies Luffanet’s websites, online services,
interactive applications, email messages may use "cookies" and other
technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies
help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our
websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the
effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information
collected by cookies and other technologies as non personal
information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by
local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.
Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with
personal information, we treat the combined information as personal
information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; And knowing
your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about
your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set
up your Cloud service, and provide you with better customer
service.&nbsp; As is true of most internet services, we gather some
information automatically and store it in log files. This information
includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language,
Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and
applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer
the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our
product and services, and to gather demographic information about our
user base as a whole. Luffanet may use this information in our
marketing services. In some of our email messages, we use a
“click-through URL” linked to content on the Luffanet website. When
customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web
server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track
this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular
topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If
you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or
graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email
messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail
has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate
messages sent to customers. Disclosure to Third Parties At times
Luffanet may make certain personal information available to strategic
partners that work with Luffanet to provide products and services, or
that help Luffanet market to customers.<br>
<br>
At times Luffanet may make certain personal information available to
strategic partners that work with Luffanet to provide products and
services, or that help Luffanet market to customers. For example, when
you purchase and activate your Luffanet devices , you authorize
Luffanet and your carrier to exchange the information you provide
during the activation process to carry out service. If you are approved
for service, your account will be governed by Luffanet and your
carrier’s respective privacy policies.<br>
<br>
Service Providers<br>
Luffanet shares personal information with companies who provide
services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling
customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing
customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in
our products and services, and conducting customer research or
satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your
information and may be located wherever Luffanet operates.<br>
<br>
Others<br>
It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or
requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside
your country of residence − for Luffanet to disclose your personal
information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine
that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other
issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.<br>
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions
or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a
reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal
information we collect to the relevant third party.<br>
<br>
Protection of Personal Information<br>
Luffanet takes the security of your personal information very
seriously. Luffanet online services&nbsp; protect your personal
information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer
Security (SSL). When your personal data is stored by Luffanet, we use
computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using
physical security measures. Cloud data is stored in encrypted form
including when we utilize third-party storage.<br>
When you use some Luffanet products, services, or applications or post
on an Luffanet forum, chat room, or social networking service, the
personal information and content you share is visible to other users
and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for
the personal information you choose to share or submit in these
instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a
forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using
these features.<br>
If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is
owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family may
be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such
shared information.<br>
<br>
Integrity and Retention of Personal Information<br>
Luffanet makes it easy for you to keep your personal information
accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal
information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or
permitted by law.<br>
<br>
Location-Based Services<br>
To provide location-based services on Luffanet products, Luffanet and
our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location
data, including the real-time geographic location of your Luffanet
computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use
GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi
hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine
your devices’ approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this
location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not
personally identify you and is used by Luffanet and our partners and
licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.
For example, your device may share its geographic location with
application providers when you opt in to their location services.<br>
<br>
Third Party Sites and Services<br>
Luffanet websites, products, applications, and services may contain
links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and
services may also use or offer products or services from third parties.<br>
Information collected by third parties, which may include such things
as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy
practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of
those third parties.<br>
