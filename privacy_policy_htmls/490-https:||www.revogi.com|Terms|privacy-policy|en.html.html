							Creating your account. The personal information that is collected when an account is created on a mobile device is used to create a user's personal account and information pages.
						</li>
						<li>
							Providing location-based services. When using Revogi devices, We may use information about your location to determine the time zone of the device. This will ensure that the device accurately displays the correct time and login service area. It will also optimize user experience by providing services such as advance activation of the corresponding device at a time set by the user. You can turn off this feature at any time by going to device settings or by discontinuing your use of this application.
						</li>
						<li>
							Accessing devices. The authenticity of devices that are operated through the app must be verified. We therefore need to confirm the legal identity of the device by consulting the factory MAC and DID information. In addition, in order to connect the device to the network, it will need to be configured through the app. During configuration, you must enter the corresponding Wi-Fi name and password. This information will only be used to connect the device to the network. The Wi-Fi and password data you enter will be encrypted and stored locally on your device; it will not be uploaded to the server. In addition, you can access the device and delete this information at any time. We also need to analyze the device's IP and network signal in order to determine the optimal network connection method. This will ensure the stability of the device network.
						</li>
						<li>
							Display of device status. This allows you to view the status of the device remotely that you can check at any time whether or not the device is running.
						</li>	
						<li>
							Providing push services. Account numbers and IMEO Numbers will also be used for the Revogi push service, which sends device notifications to the user. You can turn off this feature at any time by changing the preferences listed under "Message Settings."
						</li>
						<li>
							Collecting user feedback. The feedback you choose to provide is extremely valuable, as it helps us improve the services provided by Revogi. In order to track your feedback, Revogi may use the personal information you provide to contact you and to keep records.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sending notifications. We may occasionally use your personal information to send important notifications, for example, notifications about the status of device malfunctions; your customized device push notifications (which depend on what additional equipment you have purchased); and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
