For example, we'll ask for information like whether your thermostat is located in a home or a business, or like your home address or postal/ZIP code. This information helps us to customize your experience by, for example, retrieving weather information for your neighborhood or by enabling Home/Away Assist to automatically switch the behavior of Nest products in your home when you leave and when you come back. In addition, the Nest Learning Thermostat pulls information directly from your heating and cooling (HVAC) system to learn its capabilities - such as if it has heating and cooling or is a heating-only system.

For example, if the Nest Learning Thermostat senses that you've entered the room after an extended period of time, it can adjust the setting to a preferred temperature, based on an assumption that you've just woken up or returned home.
